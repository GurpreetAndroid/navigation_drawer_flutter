# drawer_fapp

A new Flutter project for left navigation drawer.


## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The navigation drawer in Flutter allows users to navigate to different pages of your app. The navigation drawer is added using the Drawer widget. It can be opened via swipe gesture or by clicking on the menu icon in the app bar.

To add a basic navigation drawer in Flutter, you must first use MaterialApp in your project. Then, the Drawer widget can be added to the Scaffold widget.
